# 🧬 Automated QSAR Modeling for BACE1 Inhibitors

End-to-end QSAR pipeline for predicting the bioactivity (pIC₅₀) of BACE1 inhibitors using machine learning and deep learning in Google Colab.
Fully automated — from real-time data fetching to final PDF reporting.

📌 Project Overview
This project performs Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis for BACE1 inhibitors, a promising target in Alzheimer's research. The entire workflow is built and executed within Google Colab, requiring no local setup or installation.

The pipeline automatically fetches bioactivity data from ChEMBL, calculates molecular descriptors, trains ML/DL models, generates visualizations, and exports a complete PDF report.

📌 Want to Use Locally?
While this project is Colab-based, you can also convert it into a standalone script:

Export notebook as .py (File → Download → .py)

Install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt

Run via python qsar_analysis.py

If you’d like, I can help generate that .py version and requirements.txt for GitHub.
